## Overview

**Security Policy Management (SPM)** is a tool designed to streamline how security policies are authored, evaluated, and enforced within an organization. Built in Python, the project includes:

- A policy definition engine using rule-based logic.
- User interface components for managing policies and workflows.
- Modules for validation, user registration, email verification, etc.

---

## Features

- Define security policies programmatically or via configuration files.  
- Validate and enforce rules on user actions or system states.  
- User registration and email verification workflows.  
- Extensible architecture to support custom policy logic.
